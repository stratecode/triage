GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

------------------------------------------------------------

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to
ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server
software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.

When a program is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License,
a special obligation applies when the program is modified and used to
provide a service over a network. In this case, users interacting with
the program through a network are entitled to receive the source code
of the modified version.

This license explicitly covers the situation where software is offered
as a service over a network, ensuring that users have the same freedoms
as they would if they received the software directly.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

"Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.

"Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

------------------------------------------------------------

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

------------------------------------------------------------

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License.

------------------------------------------------------------

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
source code.

------------------------------------------------------------

7. Additional Terms.

Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal
under certain conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights.

------------------------------------------------------------

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.

------------------------------------------------------------

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors.

------------------------------------------------------------

11. Patents.

A contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license.

------------------------------------------------------------

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License.

------------------------------------------------------------

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network an opportunity
to receive the Corresponding Source of your version.

------------------------------------------------------------

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.

THE PROGRAM.
